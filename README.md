Hi, I'm v3ynr! I'm a passionate learner who recently started exploring the world of web development. After diving into HTML and CSS, I decided to challenge myself by building a clone of the YouTube homepage. This project is a great way for me to apply the skills I've gained so far, and it showcases my ability to create responsive, visually appealing layouts using modern web technologies.

In this project, I focused on recreating the structure, styling, and interactivity of the YouTube homepage, while learning and experimenting with various web design concepts. From creating flexible layouts to styling navigation bars and video thumbnails, this clone highlights the essential elements of a typical YouTube page. 

## Skills and Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Used for structuring the webpage and creating the core content.
- **CSS**: Used to style the page and ensure it looks visually appealing.


## Why I Built This
Building this YouTube homepage clone was an exciting way for me to practice my HTML and CSS skills. It helped me gain confidence in my ability to structure a webpage and apply styles that not only look good but also work well on various screen sizes. As I continue to learn, I plan on adding more interactivity to this clone using JavaScript, but for now, this project is a great foundation for my web development journey.

Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or even contribute! I look forward to continuing my journey into the world of front-end development.
